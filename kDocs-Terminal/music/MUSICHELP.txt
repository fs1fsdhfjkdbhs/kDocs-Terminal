This text file is a tutorial/paragraph on how you can get your own songs in the
music.play command. I hope this helps!


                    ---DOWNLOAD YOUR OWN MUSIC!!!---

To import your own songs here, you have to first download what you want to put on,
if you already have your song, you have to drag and drop your song to the music
folder in the kDocs-Terminal folder, the one you're in/working your files with.
then after that, go to your command prompt and check your username, or you could
go to the Terminal to see your username by clicking <View> on top then click
<Terminal>. Then you should see your username. Then type an ID for the song, the
ID should be 8 characters long, like this one: 08334572. Then after that, go to
app.py and copy/type the following:




                 if commandLine == cmdMUSIC + "(your song ID here)":
            optional >>  print('Playing "(song path here)")
                         playsound.playsound('(your song path here)')

Hopefully this helped!


If you didn't understand what a path is, let me show you.

Path: An address for a file/folder that determines where the file/folder is at. For 
example, the script I am writing this at, this is how one on macOS would look like:

     /Users/(username of computer here)/(location of file/folder)/(name of file/folder)
     If you're looking for a specific file in the folder then you can add the name and format of the file,
     for example /Users/(username of computer here)/(location of file, example: Desktop)/(name of file/folder)/(name of file in folder)

On windows, paths should look like this:

     /C:Drive or This PC/(location of file/folder)/(name of file/folder)

     if you are specifing a file in a folder then,

     /C:Drive or This PC/(location of file/folder)/(name of file/folder)/(name of file in folder)
