Hello and thank you for downloading kDocs-Terminal! To run the terminal-like app, run the 
kDocs-Terminal-RUN.py file to have access! But make sure to make a password! The tutorial on doing that
should be in cmds.py and wait.py in the scripts folder. Enjoy your utility terminal!

                                        ---DISCLAMER!!---                                                 

This command line/terminal-like app is for utilities like making the computer say/do something,
DO NOT USE IT TO HACK AS THE APP WILL BE DESTROYED AND ECRYPTED!!


                                        ---NOTICE!!!!---                                                  

If you can code yourself, you can edit the scripts for yourself to make commands as this is the beta/testing
files, we are not done yet! You can type 'python3 kDocs-Terminal-RUN.py' to run the app in the Terminal.


Thank you for your attention,
